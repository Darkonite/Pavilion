# Pavilion
This was a project where I had to create a pavilion using shapes and geometric figures with OpenGL.
The project has the pavilion done, a plane surface on which the shadow is projected and a sun from which I implemented a light source. 
This light source was made to simulate the sun rays over the object.  
In the middle of the pavilion there is another light source. This light source doesn't affect too much the initial colors set on the pavilion.
The code was run on Visual Studion 2019 after a few libraries were added in the project properties.
